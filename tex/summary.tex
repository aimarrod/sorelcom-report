\chapter*{Summary}

The goal of this project is the combination of semantic, web and geospatial technologies for the development of and on-line GPS community.
 
A web application will be developed using NodeJS, a server side JavaScript programming platform, and AngularJS a single page application building framework based on the model-view-controller pattern. This system will allow users to share trails and points of interest which will be structured according to a ontology developed for this system and stored on a triplestore.

The semantic nature of the data will allow the users for a more intelligent and precise search, beyond the classic key word search. Besides, with the use of GeoSPARQL, a standard for the representation and querying of geospatial linked data the implicit relations among this data, such as which points of interest surround a trail, can be obtained.

The web application will allow the users to share their trails and enrich their information. Besides, a mobile application will give support to the system allowing the users to follow the trails of others, discovering information near them in real time and allowing them to post location aware notes on their actual location.
